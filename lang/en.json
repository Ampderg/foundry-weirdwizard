You receive no information from your senses. You grant 3 boons on rolls against you, and you automatically fail all attribute rolls.\nWhen you take damage, you first lose Health equal to the amount of damage you would take and then take the damage. For example, if you have Health 12 and take 6 damage while you are unconscious, you would reduce your Health to 6 and then take 6 damage, which would cause you to become incapacitated.",
    "WW.AsleepDesc": "If you are unconscious because you are sleeping naturally, you stop being unconscious when a creature uses an action to shake you, kick you, or do something else to waken you. A loud noise might remove the affliction if you succeed on a luck roll. Time spent sleeping counts as resting for the purpose of healing damage (see “Rest” below). If your sleep is uninterrupted, you wake up naturally whenever you choose after you fall asleep.",
    "WW.WeakenedDesc": "You make Strength and Agility rolls with 1 bane, and you grant 1 boon on rolls against your Strength and Agility. In addition, you halve your Speed, and you derive no benefit from increases to your Speed."
