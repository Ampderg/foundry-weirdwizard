# Welcome to Foundry's Weird Wizard system module
Hail!

This is a `Shadow of the Weird Wizard` system module written for [Foundry Virtual Tabletop](https://foundryvtt.com/).

Please read the instructions below to install it manually.

# Installing the Module
To install the system, follow the steps below.

1. Open `Foundry Virtual Tabletop` application.
2. Go to the `Game Systems` tab.
3. Click on the `Install System` button at the top.
4. On the new window, go to the bottom and paste `https://github.com/Savantford/foundry-weirdwizard/releases/latest/download/system.json` as URL manifest. If you want to install older versions of the system, see `Installing Older Versions` below.
5. Click on `Install`. Done!

## Installing Older Versions
If you want to install an older version of the system, you first need to get a Manifest URL (`system.json`) to that specific version.
Follow the steps below to get the Manifest URL.
1. Go to the [Releases](https://github.com/Savantford/foundry-weirdwizard/releases) section.
2. Find the version you'd like to install. The most recent versions are listed first.
3. At the end of the release post, find the `system.json` on the attachments.
4. Right click on it and copy the link address.
5. Follow the steps to install normally, but instead of using the provided `system.json` URL, use the specific version instead. Done!
